# OOT SoH Data

The JSON files in this directory are generated using SoH itself.

You can regenerate them using https://github.com/lbussell/Shipwright/commit/e959cbe5d26dc746c749f7a7abc7361fcb9039ca.
`regions.json` was generated by running a Randomizer generation using the default settings.

* [ ] TODO: Add some kind of data structure for access rules
