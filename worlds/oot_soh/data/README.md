# OOT SoH Data

The JSON files in this directory are generated using SoH itself.

You can regenerate them using https://github.com/lbussell/Shipwright/commit/cec509726c3e10e682c9e707b2dc0e8595e6ca7c.
`regions.json` was generated by running a Randomizer generation using the default settings.

* [ ] TODO: Add some kind of data structure for access rules
